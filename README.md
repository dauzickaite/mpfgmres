# mpfgmres
split-preconditioned FGMRES in four precisions

Code for reproducing results in E. Carson and I. Dauzickaite (2023), STABILITY OF SPLIT-PRECONDITIONED FGMRES IN FOUR PRECISIONS. MATLAB R2021a is used.

Run `run_script.mâ€™.

Note: requires chop (https://github.com/higham/chop), advanpix toolbox (https://www.advanpix.com/), and triangular solver in half precision trisols.m (https://github.com/SrikaraPranesh/Multi_precision_NLA_kernels).
